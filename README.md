# hello-world
First repository made using a github guide

I'm gonna do my best so I can work for Crunchyroll in San Fransisco.

So far, I feel confident in HTML, CSS, some C++ and Java.  I need to work on my PHP and Javascript coding skills.  I also need to fully comprehend data structures (I haven't practiced binary trees, stacks, and queues).  I have a lot to work on.  Also, I have to do a lot of projects and complete certificates in order to make up for my lack of experience.  I'm a bit scared about the amount of work I have to do.  But I really want to be good at what I do.
